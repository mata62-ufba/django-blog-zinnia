### pylint

Manual: https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/pylint/latest/pylint.pdf

It supports a number of features, from coding standards to error detection, 
and it also helps with refactoring (by detecting duplicated code);
fully customizable through a pylintrc file.

The first letter in each line will map to Convention, Refactor, Warning, or Error.

Pylint ships with Pyreverse, with which it creates UML diagrams for your code.
